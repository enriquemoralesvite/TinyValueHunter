# MinValueFinder

A Python utility to find the smallest value in a list, starting from a specified index. This simple script demonstrates an iterative approach to minimum value searching, perfect for learning or experimenting with basic algorithms and Python list operations.

## Features
- Searches for the smallest value in a list starting from the second element (index 1).
- Lightweight, beginner-friendly implementation.
- Example usage included in the script.

## How It Works
The `SearchMinFromList` function iterates through the provided list, starting from the second element. It compares each value to the current minimum and updates the minimum if a smaller value is found.

### Example
```python
from min_value_finder import SearchMinFromList

L = [23, -4, 0, 73, -10, 13]
result = SearchMinFromList(L)
print("The minimum value is:", result)
```
**Output:**
```
The minimum value is: -10
```

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply download or clone the repository and use the provided script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MinValueFinder.git
```

## Usage
1. Import the `SearchMinFromList` function into your Python project.
2. Pass a list of numbers to the function.
3. Retrieve the minimum value starting from the second element.
